## 🎯 Your Task: Create Your Own "About Me" Page!

Modify the existing files to create a webpage about yourself. Here’s what you can try:

### **1️⃣ Update the HTML**
In `index.html`, replace the text inside the `<h1>` and `<p>` tags to add your own name and introduction.

```html
<h1>Hello, I'm [Your Name]!</h1>
<p>I'm learning CSS, and this is my first styled webpage. 🚀</p>
```

### **2️⃣ Style It with CSS**
Go to `styles.css` and customize the styles. Try changing:

- **Background color**:
  ```css
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
  ```

- **Text color**:
  ```css
  h1 {
    color: darkblue;
  }
  ```

- **Font size**:
  ```css
  p {
    font-size: 20px;
  }
  ```

### **3️⃣ Add an Image**
In `index.html`, add an image tag inside the `<section>`:

```html
<img src="your-image.jpg" alt="My Picture" width="200">
```

Make sure the image file is in the same folder as your HTML file.
